"W3C Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 2","The Web Services Description Language (WSDL pronounced ""wiz'-dul"") is an XML-based interface definition language that is used for describing the functionality offered by a web service.

It thus serves a purpose that corresponds roughly to that of a method signature in a programming language. The current version of WSDL is WSDL 2.0.

"WfMC XML Process Definition Language (XPDL) 2","The XML Process Definition Language (XPDL) is a format standardized by the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) to interchange Business Process definitions between different workflow products, ie between different modeling tools and management suites. XPDL defines an XML schema for specifying the declarative part of workflow / business process. XPDL is designed to exchange the process definition, both the graphics and the semantics of a workflow business process. XPDL is currently the best file format for exchange of BPMN diagrams; it has been designed specifically to store all aspects of a BPMN diagram. XPDL contains elements to hold graphical information, such as the X and Y position of the nodes, as well as executable aspects which would be used to run a process. This distinguishes XPDL from BPEL which focuses exclusively on the executable aspects of the process. BPEL does not contain elements to represent the graphical aspects of a process diagram.",Software,"Scripting Language","Approved - Maintain",
